# AWS SDK for Node.js

The official JavaScript implementation of the AWS SDK for Node.js.

## Installing

The preferred way to install the AWS SDK for Node.js is to use the
[npm](http://npmjs.org) package manager for Node.js. Simply type the following
into a terminal window:

```sh
npm install aws-sdk
```

**Please Note**: Installing the `aws-sdk` npm package on Windows may display errors while trying to install the optional dependency for `libxmljs`.  This error can be **safely ignored**.

## Usage

After you've installed the SDK, you can require the AWS package in your node
application using `require`:

```js
var AWS = require('aws-sdk');
```

Here is a quick example that makes some requests against Amazon S3 with the SDK:

```js
// Load the AWS SDK for Node.js
var AWS = require('aws-sdk');

/**
 * Don't hard-code your credentials!
 * Load them from disk or your environment instead.
 */
// AWS.config.update({accessKeyId: 'AKID', secretAccessKey: 'SECRET'});

// Instead, do this:
AWS.config.loadFromPath('./path/to/credentials.json');

// Set your region for future requests.
AWS.config.update({region: 'us-east-1'});

// Create a bucket and put something in it.
var s3 = new AWS.S3();
s3.client.createBucket({Bucket: 'myBucket'}, function() {
  var data = {Bucket: 'myBucket', Key: 'myKey', Body: 'Hello!'};
  s3.client.putObject(data, function(err, data) {
    if (err) {
      console.log("Error uploading data: ", err);
    } else {
      console.log("Successfully uploaded data to myBucket/myKey");
    }
  });
});
```
