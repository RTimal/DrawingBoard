With the ugly HTML still in your clipboard run this command:\n\n`pbpaste | html | pbcopy`\n\nNow when you paste your clipboard into an editor you will get nice, pretty printed HTML:\n\n![After pretty printing](https://github.com/maxogden/commonjs-html-prettyprinter/raw/master/img/after.png)\n\n## Building\n\nTo rebuild the html module to use the latest version of [js-beautifier], see the following instructions:\n\n- clone this repo: `git clone git://github.com/maxogden/commonjs-html-prettyprinter.git`\n- install dev dependencies: `npm install`\n- run the build: `npm run-script build`\n\nAt this point, the `lib/html.js` file should have been updated with the latest copy of the source from [js-beautifier]\n\n[js-beautifier]: https://github.com/einars/js-beautify\n",
